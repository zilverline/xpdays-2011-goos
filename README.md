Auctioning trips - The code for the GOOS session at XP Days 2011
================================================================

This project contains the application which we ([@larsvonk](http://www.twitter.com/larsvonk) and [@munkius](http://www.twitter.com/munkius)) developed during our session. The session was about Growing Object Oriented Software, Guided By Tests. The goal is to get to a Walking Skeleton as fast as you can.
